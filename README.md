# Smart-Museums
The development of Smart Museums app started as a group project, meant to encourage teamwork between students and also make them discover and use new technologies. Now we have reached the point where our project has a practical dimension and can be easily integrated in the experience of visiting a local museum. How? Simply view the exhibit you’re interested in through your phone screen and instantly multiple pieces of information will pop up on the screen. The app user will be able to choose between a text description, audio files, browsing through an image gallery of related exhibits, thus finding out even more details of the author’s work. In a society where technology has been gaining ground in more and more areas, we believe our app is a great way to ensure a friendly and smart experience, regardless the visitor’s age or the contact he has had with similar applications until then.
